O2
==

This folder contains the O2 work on the new AOD design. The design is based on
an Entity-Component system (note: not an Entity-Component-System system).  The
entities and components are defined in the `Entities` and `Components` folder
respectively. The system itself is contained in the `ecs` folder. Details for
each are contained in a `README.md` in the corresponding folder.

Both entities and components have to implement a static `const char* Id()`
function in order to identify them in the datasets.

This folder contains files relevant to the conversion of ESD files to the "new
AOD" format (temporary working version) and subsequent analysis of this format.
Examples of how to use these files are contained in the
[sister-repository](https://github.com/RDeckers/AliO2ConversionMacros).


How to compile
--------------

This feature requires ROOT 6. To compile it with aliBuild, you have to use the
`root6` defaults:

    aliBuild build AliRoot --defaults root6

Remember to pass aliBuild the other parameters you usually use (for instance,
`-w <path_to_sw_folder>`.
